# AI Governance Strategy Tool - Game Design Document

## Game Concept

The AI Governance Strategy Tool is an interactive strategy simulation that puts players in the role of a shadow global AI policy coordinator. Players must navigate complex trade-offs between limited resources, political constraints, and uncertain outcomes to build an effective AI governance framework.

## Core Mechanics

### Resource Management
- **Budget**: Financial resources ($80B - $400B depending on difficulty)
- **Political Capital**: Represents political feasibility and support (8-40 PC)
- **Temperature**: Environmental favorability affecting success probability (5%-95%)

### Strategic Framework
Players build their governance approach through four categories:

1. **Strategic Postures** (Pick one, free of charge)
   - Laissez-faire, AI clubs/blocs, Open Global Investment
   - MAD/MAIM, Global Moratorium, Cooperative development
   - D/Acc, Non-proliferation, Strategic advantage

2. **Institutional Architectures** (Multiple selections allowed)
   - International bodies, regulatory agencies, governance structures
   - Each has cost in budget and political capital

3. **Regulatory/Legal Mechanisms** (Multiple selections allowed)
   - Auditing, liability, transparency requirements
   - Market-shaping mechanisms and safety frameworks

4. **Technical & Infrastructural Controls** (Multiple selections allowed)
   - Hardware/software verification, compute caps
   - Export controls and kill-switch protocols

### Complexity Systems

#### Requirements & Dependencies
- Certain strategic postures mandate specific supporting options
- Some combinations are prerequisite for others
- Players must satisfy all requirements before locking in

#### Synergies & Contradictions
- **Synergies**: Complementary options that enhance overall effectiveness
- **Contradictions**: Conflicting approaches that reduce success probability
- **Network Effects**: Some options become more powerful when combined

#### Uncertainty & Outcomes
- **Base Success Rates**: Each strategic posture has inherent probability
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 1000-trial statistical analysis
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature affects all outcomes
- **Coherence Penalties**: Contradictory choices reduce effectiveness

## Difficulty Modes

| Mode | Budget | Political Capital | Temperature | Description |
|------|--------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Easy (Optimist) | $400B | 40 PC | 95% | Favorable environment, ample resources |
| Medium (Realist) | $240B | 24 PC | 70% | Balanced challenge with moderate constraints |
| Hard (Pessimist) | $160B | 16 PC | 35% | Hostile environment, severe limitations |
| Expert (Yudkowskyite) | $160B | 16 PC | 5% | Maximum difficulty with minimal success chance |

## Player Journey

### Phase 1: Setup
1. Choose difficulty mode
2. Review available resources
3. Understand win conditions

### Phase 2: Strategy Selection  
1. Select one strategic posture (establishes overall approach)
2. Build supporting portfolio within budget constraints
3. Navigate requirements and avoid contradictions

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Use search to explore options
2. Balance synergies against cost
3. Ensure all requirements satisfied

### Phase 4: Analysis
1. Lock in final selection
2. Run single outcome or Monte Carlo analysis
3. Interpret results and learn from outcomes

## Success Metrics

### Individual Outcomes
- Binary success/failure based on probability rolls
- Narrative feedback explaining the result
- Factors contributing to success/failure

### Monte Carlo Analysis
- Success rate across 1000 trials

## Design Philosophy

The tool balances **realism** with **accessibility**, providing enough complexity to reflect real policy challenges while remaining engaging for non-experts. It emphasizes **uncertainty** and **trade-offs** rather than presenting simple solutions, encouraging players to think critically about AI governance challenges.

The simulation is explicitly **non-prescriptive** - it presents options and their assessed characteristics without advocating for specific approaches, allowing players to explore different philosophies and draw their own conclusions about effective AI governance.
