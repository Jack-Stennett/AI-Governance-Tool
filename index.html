        <p>The earth has entered a race for AI supremacy. You are tasked to allocate global resources to ensure that humans emerge safely from this situation.</p>
        <p>You will pick what global posture to take, which mechanisms we need to implement this, and how much budget and political capital you have to work with.</p>
